1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,960
I'm sorry to ask, uh, this question
almost, but it's something that I

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,550
think is a little bit important.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,140
Um, how do you think it affects the
culture of a community of a project

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,330
when the leader is on that projects?

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,250
Uh, public mailing.

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,485
Telling people in response to
Patrick views that they should

7
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:18,044
be retroactively aborted.

8
00:00:18,405 --> 00:00:18,585
Right.

9
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:22,244
And maybe that you're surprised that
they're still alive because they

10
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:24,465
should have starved to death when
they were children, because they were

11
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:27,225
too stupid to find a ship to suck on.

12
00:00:27,604 --> 00:00:34,685
I, I agree that some people might feel
put off by that, but on the other hand,

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,810
You know what I, in the end, I don't care.

14
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,470
Right.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,840
I care about technology and I've actually
seen projects that took the whole

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,130
political correctness so far that the
project no longer is about the tech.

17
00:00:52,225 --> 00:01:00,955
Um, I actually, so my, wow,
we're getting more questions.

18
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:04,285
I think at some point we
may want to moderate them.

19
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:08,335
So my team don't get you.

20
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:10,585
I actually am very happy
to talk about this.

21
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:11,875
It's not a problem for me.

22
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:16,885
Um, my standpoint has always been
that, Hey, people are different.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,660
I'm abrasive.

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,870
I grew up in a culture that I think is
not quite as politically correct as the

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,820
culture, especially in the U S today.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,890
I also grew up in a family
that was largely dysfunctional.

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,650
So, um, I mean, so people are
different and some people take

28
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,790
offense and some people give offense
and we all have to live together.

29
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,500
But the living together is not by
finding some lowest common denominator.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,110
The living together.

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,640
And it has actually been fairly
successful is to try and realize

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,700
that, Hey, unlike your family, you
can actually pick your friends and

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:02,009
you can take the coworkers and open
source is actually really good at that.

34
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:07,965
Better so than many commercial software
projects, because in commercial setting,

35
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:13,565
you're kind of stuck with your boss
in open source, find people you like

36
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,635
find people you like working with.

37
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:21,665
Um, I, I work directly with.

38
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:29,685
Let's say 20 people closely and
50 people more or less, right?

39
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:31,335
There's every release.

40
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:37,035
There's a thousand people involved
find somebody who liked better than me.

41
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:38,235
That's fine.

42
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:38,745
Right.

43
00:02:39,135 --> 00:02:42,825
I'm not willing to be less honest.

44
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:46,365
Uh, because I know I'm abrasive, right.

45
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:53,825
And quite often the whole, like when I
say something like, I wonder how he grew

46
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:59,285
to be an adult when he's so stupid that
he, I don't expect him to find food.

47
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:05,795
Some people might realize that
it's kind of hyperbole and joke.

48
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:06,695
Not I'm not.

49
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:10,185
I'm not saying something
bad that, you know, it's not

50
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,415
politically correct or whatever.

51
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:16,035
Although certainly I would understand if
people do say this, it's more about, um,

52
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:20,855
treating other people with respect and
maybe technical, you know what I mean?

53
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:24,185
You going to flow at everything you
want, but I don't respect people on this.

54
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:26,855
I think they deserve the respect.

55
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,275
There are people who think that respect
is something that should be given.

56
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:35,405
And I happened to be one of the people
who are perfectly happy saying no.

57
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,635
Respect should be earned.

58
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,335
And without being
earned, you don't get it.

59
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:40,845
Right.

60
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:46,575
It's really that simple and not
everybody agrees and that's fine too.

61
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:47,115
Right.

62
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,785
There are people I refuse to work with.

63
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,165
Right.

64
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:57,165
It's it cuts both ways
and I realized that.

65
00:03:58,175 --> 00:03:58,865
Okay, thank you.

66
00:03:58,925 --> 00:03:59,135
Thanks.
